# Warp 

# Notes to self: 
Currently, warp runs into permissions errors that need to be fixed, and the
bash script responsible for running the program needs to have the executable in a findable place. 
Beyond those limitations, this is minimally viable. 

# Extensions: 
 - Keep track of commonly used directories to add to the program proactively. 
 - Add tags to group directories and projects. 
 - fzf matching when jumping. 
 - colored output 
 - undo / remove last used warp point (useful for misspelled names)
 - Show current warp point in terminal (Actually useful??)
 - Shortcuts (warp -1 to last point, warp -2 to the one before that, etc.)
 - nvim integration? Would be nice to be able to warp to directory and immediately open nvim.
